- App saves your data automaticly and instantly after every action and it is always saved with encryption, so you can just close app in any moment. Data will be safely saved. 
- App provides autoclose option allowing app to close after defined amount of time. Feature can be easly enabled or disabled in autoclose options (main menu)

## Important Informations!!!
- Default password is empty, so when changing vault's password for the first time, just leave "old password" untouched. Also if you accidently lock container without changing password you can always unlock it by leaving the unlock password empty
